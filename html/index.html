        <h1>The Hacker Attitude</h1>
        <article id="article-content">
            <p>Hackers solve problems and build things, and they believe in freedom
                and voluntary mutual help. To be accepted as a hacker, you have to
                behave as though you have this kind of attitude yourself. And to
                behave as though you have the attitude, you have to really believe the
                attitude.</p>
            <p>But if you think of cultivating hacker attitudes as just a way
                to gain acceptance in the culture, you'll miss the point. Becoming
                the kind of person who believes these things is important for
                <em>you</em></span> - for helping you learn and keeping you
                motivated. As with all creative arts, the most effective way to
                become a master is to imitate the mind-set of masters - not just
                intellectually but emotionally as well.</p>
            <p>Or, as the following modern Zen poem has it:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code class="code-style">
                To follow the path:<br/>
                look to the master,<br/>
                follow the master,<br/>
                walk with the master,<br/>
                see through the master,<br/>
                become the master.<br/>
            </code>
            </div>
            <p>So, if you want to be a hacker, repeat the following things until
                you believe them:</p>
            <div>
                <h3></a>1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to
                    be solved.</h3>
                <p>Being a hacker is lots of fun, but it's a kind of fun that takes
                    lots of effort. The effort takes motivation. Successful athletes get
                    their motivation from a kind of physical delight in making their
                    bodies perform, in pushing themselves past their own physical limits.
                    Similarly, to be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solving
                    problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>If you aren't the kind of person that feels this way naturally, you'll
                    need to become one in order to make it as a hacker. Otherwise you'll
                    find your hacking energy is sapped by distractions like sex, money, and
                    social approval.</p>
                <p>(You also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning
                    capacity - a belief that even though you may not know all of what you
                    need to solve a problem, if you tackle just a piece of it and learn
                    from that, you'll learn enough to solve the next piece - and so on,
                    until you're done.)</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3></a>2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.</h3>
                <p>Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
                    wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating
                    new problems waiting out there.</p>
                <p>To behave like a hacker, you have to believe that the thinking time of
                    other hackers is precious - so much so that it's almost a moral duty
                    for you to share information, solve problems and then give the
                    solutions away just so other hackers can solve <em>new</em></span>
                    problems instead of having to perpetually re-address old ones.</p>
                <p>Note, however, that "No problem should ever have to be solved
                    twice." does not imply that you have to consider all existing
                    solutions sacred, or that there is only one right solution to any
                    given problem. Often, we learn a lot about the problem that we didn't
                    know before by studying the first cut at a solution. It's OK, and
                    often necessary, to decide that we can do better. What's not OK is
                    artificial technical, legal, or institutional barriers (like
                    closed-source code) that prevent a good solution from being re-used
                    and <em></em>force</em></span> people to re-invent wheels.</p>
                <p>(You don't have to believe that you're obligated to give
                    <em>all</em></span> your creative product away, though the
                    hackers that do are the ones that get most respect from other hackers.
                    It's consistent with hacker values to sell enough of it to keep you in
                    food and rent and computers. It's fine to use your hacking skills to
                    support a family or even get rich, as long as you don't forget your
                    loyalty to your art and your fellow hackers while doing it.)</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3></a>3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.</h3>
                <p>Hackers (and creative people in general) should never be bored or have
                    to drudge at stupid repetitive work, because when this happens it
                    means they aren't doing what only they can do - solve new problems.
                    This wastefulness hurts everybody. Therefore boredom and drudgery are
                    not just unpleasant but actually evil.</p>
                <p>To behave like a hacker, you have to believe this enough to want to
                    automate away the boring bits as much as possible, not just for
                    yourself but for everybody else (especially other hackers).</p>
                <p>(There is one apparent exception to this. Hackers will
                    sometimes do things that may seem repetitive or boring to an observer
                    as a mind-clearing exercise, or in order to acquire a skill or have
                    some particular kind of experience you can't have otherwise. But this
                    is by choice - nobody who can think should ever be forced into a
                    situation that bores them.)</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3></a>4. Freedom is good.</h3>
                <p>Hackers are naturally anti-authoritarian. Anyone who can give you
                    orders can stop you from solving whatever problem you're being
                    fascinated by - and, given the way authoritarian minds work, will
                    generally find some appallingly stupid reason to do so. So the
                    authoritarian attitude has to be fought wherever you find it, lest
                    it smother you and other hackers.</p>
                <p>(This isn't the same as fighting all authority. Children need to be
                    guided and criminals restrained. A hacker may agree to accept some
                    kinds of authority in order to get something he wants more than the
                    time he spends following orders. But that's a limited, conscious
                    bargain; the kind of personal surrender authoritarians want is not on
                    offer.)</p>
                <p>Authoritarians thrive on censorship and secrecy. And they
                    distrust voluntary cooperation and information-sharing - they
                    only like 'cooperation' that they control. So to behave
                    like a hacker, you have to develop an instinctive hostility to
                    censorship, secrecy, and the use of force or deception to compel
                    responsible adults. And you have to be willing to act on that
                    belief.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3></a>5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.</h3>
                <p>To be a hacker, you have to develop some of these attitudes. But
                    copping an attitude alone won't make you a hacker, any more than it
                    will make you a champion athlete or a rock star. Becoming a hacker
                    will take intelligence, practice, dedication, and hard work.</p>
                <p>Therefore, you have to learn to distrust attitude and respect
                    competence of every kind. Hackers won't let posers waste their time,
                    but they worship competence - especially competence at hacking, but
                    competence at anything is valued. Competence at demanding skills that
                    few can master is especially good, and competence at demanding skills
                    that involve mental acuteness, craft, and concentration is best.</p>
                <p>If you revere competence, you'll enjoy developing it in yourself
                    - the hard work and dedication will become a kind of intense play
                    rather than drudgery. That attitude is vital to becoming a
                    hacker.</p>
